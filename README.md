## How to run

#### Prerequisites / set up
* install `node` (I recommend via `nvm`) and `yarn`
* `cd backend; yarn; cd ..`
* `cd frontend; yarn; cd ..`

#### Start the server
* `cd backend`
* `node server.js --plex=X` where X is the number of lanes you wish to simulate
* wait until the terminal indicates that the data is loaded

#### Start the frontend (in development mode)
* `cd frontend; yarn start`
* visit `localhost:3000`
