# Running RAMPART

* move into the `rampart` directory
* ensure you have a [config file](config.md) set up (or use one of the examples below)
* `node rampart.js --config <CONFIG>`
* _run `node rampart.js -h` to see all available command line options. `--basecalledDir` is especially useful_
* Open [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in a browser


# Example datasets
Note that these are already basecalled and so will run faster than real-time.
All that is needed is the config file, run as above!

* `./examples/EBOV/configuration.json`
